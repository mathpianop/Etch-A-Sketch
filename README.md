# Etch-A-Sketch
DOM practice project:
 First of all, I'm going to use this as an opportunty to practice using git.

 5/17 10:17 -- Next, I need to find a way to apply a "hover" event listener to the divs. This means I need a way to access all child elements of #container?

 5/18 11:00 -- Next, I need to make the button reset, and then have the prompt generalize.

5/18 5:36 -- It works, but it's slow to reset at higher values, and crashes around 400/side. I need to figure out what the limit is. Also, see if there's any way to make this more effecient. Also, gotta fix this color scheme.

 -End tasks: Make it look a tad nicer. Create two buttons, one for reset, and another for side input.  Run by Ben.
